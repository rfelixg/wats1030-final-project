# wats1030-final-project

The final project in this course is a project to deploy a web application, with customizations and configured for your purposes, deployed to a custom domain. You will fulfill the following <b>base requirements</b> as you work through the assignments to build out your final project:

# Base Requirements 

1. Determine a website concept you can customize and deploy using a pre-existing open source web application.
2. Install that application on a suitable server.
3. Customize the application by either installing a pre-existing theme, using provided tools to customize the look and feel, or modifying provided stylesheets and templates to create a personalized look for your project. (Please note: You are not expected to "build a theme" for this webapp unless you are pursuing a stretch goal. If, for example, you're using Wordpress for your site, you must install a theme of your choosing, and many themes will offer additional customization options to provide custom logos, choose different color palettes, etc. For the base requirement, you are expected to do something along those lines.)
4. Configure the application to use the best practices outlined for that specific application to provide a fast, secure application for users and staff alike.
5. Make your application available at a custom domain. (Please note: Your custom domain may be a subdomain of your personal domain, such as "mywebapp.yourname.com".)

If these requirements prove very easy for you to fulfill, then you are encouraged to pursue the following <b>stretch requirements</b>:

# Stretch Requirements

1. Increase the technical complexity of your project. (e.g. Rather than deploying a simple PHP/mySQL app, deploy a Python app or a set of Docker containers.)
2. Create a new theme for your webapp. (Build a theme for your chosen webapp starting with their theme starter kit, using whatever techniques and approaches they require.)
3. Combine apps in an innovative way. (e.g. Can you attach a great gallery system to your Wordpress install? Set up BuddyPress and integrate a service that tracks hikes?)
4. Build a custom frontend. (Some webapps make it easy to reveal a RESTful API that can be accessed from a custom frontend built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This means you can use, for example, the content management admin and database from Wordpress, but deliver content through a totally custom creative frontend you build using different fancy Javascript libraries.)

In order to do this, we will work over the final 4 weeks of the quarter. The following project assignments make up the series that we spend building our final webapp project:

- <b>Final Project Planning Phase</b><br>
This portion of the project focuses on planning what you will need to support your chosen web app and project.
- <b>Final Project Site Customization, Theming and Setup</b><br>
This project allows you to work through visual look and feel as well as custom features you wish to install and configure with your application.
- <b>Final Project Caching, Optimization, and Security</b><br>
This project assignment asks you to think about speed enhancements and security hardening to protect yourself and your users according to whatever the best practices available for your chosen technologies are.
- <b>Final Project Completed Website Deployment</b><br>
This is the completed deployment of your web project, made available at a custom domain of your choosing.
